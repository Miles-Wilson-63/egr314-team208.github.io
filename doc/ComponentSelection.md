**Description: **
* The bill of materials contains all the parts each section of the nerve damage therapy glove will be utilizing. All parts meet the requirements and unless specified otherwise are surface mounted.  Everything from the voltage regulators to the OP-AMP and even our resistors and capacitors are surface-mounted. The only parts that aren’t surface mounted are the barrel jack, motor, microcontroller, and wall plug to supply power to the device.  A variety of communication methods are utilized such as SPI, UART, and I2C.  Our wall power supply supplies voltage at a measurement of 5V and 1A to a switching voltage regulator. From the switching voltage regulator the power drops down and comes out to 3.3 V. Our force sensors are resistive which utilize an ADC device to convert their analog signals to SPI so it can be read by the microcontroller. The ESP32 utilizes UART to communicate all this data over wifi to a digital storage space such as someone’s personal device or the medical records system at a doctor’s office.

| D. Select a specific external power source (wall supply or battery) for your system, and confirm that it can supply all of the regulators for all of the power rails simultaneously. If you need multiple power sources, list each separately below and indicate which regulators will be connected to each supply. Confirm that the Total Remaining Current Available on each power source below is not negative. |                                                              |                  |              |     |              |      |       |
