* For our design ideation process we agreed on four main categories to focus on. They were electrical, movement, material, and miscellaneous. Then all team members started listing ideas for what the product should have based on the main categories. The best brainstorming method for us was Rapid Ideation. We looked at all of our benchmarked products and took the best from each of them while finding ways to improve them .Then we just started throwing everything we could think of onto the jamboard until we couldn't come up with any more ideas. Mind mapping didn't work for us as we started coming up with too many main ideas we wanted to focus on and was taking too much time.

* After coming up with all the ideas we then went through each one individually and determined whether we wanted to include it or not and whether or not they meant our requirements for the project. Miles drew the Balloon Grip Sensor Therapeutic Glove while Kyle drew the Variable Force Sensing Temperature/Pressure Glove and Mingqi did the Velcro on Fingers for Various Sizes.
