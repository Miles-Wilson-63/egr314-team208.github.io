**Description:**
* The team schematic has been broken into sections to reduce confusion\. There are six major sections in the team system\. These are the switching voltage regulator, temperature sensor, LED array, motor driver, force sensors, and the microcontroller\. Each section has arrows on the end of wires that connect to other sections\. These arrows indicate the exact pin that wire should connect to\.
