**Final Microcontroller Choice: PIC16F18875-I/P**

* Rationale: Team 208 decided to move forward with PIC16F18875-I/P because of the three microcontrollers it had the most user and application notes. It also meets all of the project's requirements at the lowest overhead and doesn’t require separate hardware to work. This part also comes in a through hole and surface mount option for project implementation.
