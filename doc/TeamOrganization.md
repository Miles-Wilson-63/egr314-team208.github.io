## 1. Team Organization

**Charter:**

* Based on the goals listed above and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter: 

-To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project.-

* Product Mission Statement

* Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

-Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi.-
