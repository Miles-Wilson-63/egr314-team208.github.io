## 2. User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

**Our Process:**
* To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design.

   <td>“So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own.
<p>
After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind - you know, like your body should! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough!
<p>
The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do.
<p>
Obviously, your mileage may vary. Everyone works at their own pace and can only do what they can, but I see how this device can help people relearn to use their hand. She'll never be 100%, but every little bit counts.”

The device uses a comfortable amount of pressure to provoke exercise. (explicit)

<li>The glove forces the user to extend and retract fingers to promote movement in limbs. (explicit)

  <tr>
   <td>“What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor (orange box). Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius. The mirror glove is worn on the non-training hand. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable.”

**Product Requirements**

**Our Process:**

	The team decided that each major category of the product requirements will just be the major categories that our user needs are organized into. These groups are not the suggested groups, but we felt like these will better inform our design based on our user needs. This will make it easier to both rank and generate the product requirements. The product requirement list below is organized from the most important major category at the top and least at the bottom. Within each category the top most product requirement is the most important of that category.

**Stakeholders:**

Target Users: People with nerve damage or limited mobility in the hand.

Target Purchasers: This can be the target user directly or healthcare professionals for use in a facility.

Sponsor and Advisors: ASU acts as a financial sponsor. EGR314 and Professor Aukes act as advisors to the final product.

**Use Cases:**

Case #1: Mrs. Haro has nerve damage in her right hand. This has left her without the ability to gauge her grip strength or feel anything in her hand for that matter. She decides to try out a new therapeutic device. It's a glove that allows her to know her grip strength in her right hand. This not only gives her more confidence and functionality in her hand, but also a mind-body relationship with her grip strength as well. A temperature sensor is integrated into the product so she doesn’t burn her hand on her hot coffee cup.

Case #2: Mr. Jacobs got in a car accident recently and is recovering from his injuries. His left hand is weak and suffers from clawing. A healthcare professional decides that a new therapeutic machine is best for his physical therapy. The new machine allows his hand to strengthen and accurately grip objects again. The data from the machine is sent via wi-fi to the hospital server. Mr. Jacobs doctor, after seeing the data, decides Jacobs is ready for stronger resistance on the machine. The doctor plugs into the machine and alters the resistance via PuTTY motor control. Jacobs recovers in a few weeks and no longer needs the machine to gauge his grip strength.

**User Needs:**
