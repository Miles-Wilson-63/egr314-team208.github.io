<a id="_iju35qeccrew"></a>NERVE DAMAGE THERAPY GLOVE PROJECT

# <a id="_vj5zr8wlauw7"></a>Team 208’s Charter: 

## <a id="_qasscle5jf43"></a>Charter

Based on the goals listed above and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter:

*To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project\.*

## <a id="_iuaqc515hz76"></a>Product Mission Statement

Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

*Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions\. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data\. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication\. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals\. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course\. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi\.*

# <a id="_flvp2fv3jcfg"></a>User Needs: 

__Our Process: __To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord\. This made sharing screens and files easy\. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas\. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board\. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of\. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table\. Then we organized all the user needs into groups\. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category\. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them\. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well\. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design\.  Based on the reviews the team saw on Amazon and other websites we then compiled and created a list of needs to suit the requirements of our product requirements

# <a id="_veopb0sev01r"></a>Product Requirements

__Our Process:__ The team decided that each major category of the product requirements will  be the major categories that our user needs are organized into\. These groups are not the suggested groups, but we felt like these will better inform our design based on our user needs\. This will make it easier to both rank and generate the product requirements as we come up with and design our concepts\. The product requirement list below is organized from the most important major category at the top and least at the bottom\. Within each category the top most product requirement is the most important of that category\.

# <a id="_e1qgr3gq65zx"></a>Design Ideation

__Idea Generation Process:__ For Team 208’s Design Ideation, we chose to look at what characteristics made our benchmarked examples successful products and how they could be improved upon\. Listed below are one hundred ideas that discuss various aspects of potential design movements, material considerations, electrical component ideas, and other other potential successful characteristics\. Once we had generated one hundred ideas, they were separated then into color coordinated categories and grouped  based on their ability to meet our project requirements\. 

## <a id="_v3axfqt7fah1"></a>Design Concepts:

__Balloon Grip Sensor Therapeutic Glove:__

__Description:__ This concept will be tethered to a wall power supply to avoid the need for a battery\. The wall power supply will then go to a control box that houses our PCB\. This will protect the PCB and make the glove design more streamlined\. This box will have LED indicators to display how hard someone is gripping\. The glove will have a balloon with a pressure sensor inside it to measure the grip strength of someone's hand\. The motor on the back of the hand will increase tension in the glove if a person is gripping too hard, and release if they decrease grip strength\. This design will meet all class requirements\. This design will also feature a temperature sensor that can indicate if someone is gripping something too hot\.

__Variable Force Sensing Temperature/Pressure Glove__

__Description: __This design will be battery powered for extra mobility\. It will be fully enclosed in the glove and will not have any external parts\. A compression sleeve on each finger will be the actuator\. These will relax the fingers when someone is gripping too hard\. LED indicators on the side of the glove will indicate grip strength\. There will also be a LED screen for easy viewing of data\. This design meets all class requirement

__Velcro on Fingers for Various Sizes__

# <a id="_797kv2l8er9t"></a>Selected Design

__Current Design Description:__ The selected design is based mostly on the balloon grip sensor, with aspects from the other two designs\. This new design will have two force sensors on the end of the index finger and the inside of the thumb\. These sensors will be in place of the balloon pressure sensor\. The team decided that the balloon would be too complex to manufacture and calibrate\. The temperature sensor will be on the palm of the glove, this will sense if something is too hot to be touching\. A motor on top of the wrist will pull on resistive bands attached to each finger when a person is exceeding a certain grip strength\. Data from the sensors will be communicated wirelessly\. The PCB itself will not be attached to the glove and instead be housed in a protective case external to the glove\. This external control box will have three LEDs on it to indicate user grip strength\. The design will be powered by a wall power supply and is not designed to be worn casually\. Instead this device will be designed to be used in physical therapy settings with people that have little to no feeling in their hands, due to nerve damage\.

__CAD Assembly of Control Box Housing__

__CAD Exploded Assembly of Control Box Housing__

__Control Box Description:__ The control box will have two holes near the bottom\. One for the signal, power, and ground wires that lead to the glove, and the other for the wall power supply\. The box also features three holes for the three indicator LEDs\. 

__Drawing of Glove__

__Glove Description:__ The glove will feature force sensors on the index finger and the thumb, a temperature sensor on the inside of the palm, and a motor on the back of the hand\. The motor will pull at the resistive bands on each finger\. A cable will run from the glove to the control box that will provide power, ground, and signal transmission\.

# <a id="_38u2zui3pl9g"></a>

# <a id="_rl77ufse3z8p"></a>Block Diagram:

__Description:__ To deliver power to our nerve damage pressure glove we will be using a wall outlet 

that supplies 5V and 1A to power up the device and let it function\. Power will pass into a voltage regulator where it will output at 3\.3V and proceed to the microcontroller\. The microcontroller will be connected to and receive data from all of our sensors\. When a user holds on to something with the glove the thin film pressure sensors will relay that information back to the microcontroller via ADC which converts it into an SPI signal\. Our ESP32 wifi module utilizes UART and can upload the information to the server at a medical facility or someone's phone\.

__Description:__ The bill of materials contains all the parts each section of the nerve damage therapy glove will be utilizing\. All parts meet the requirements and unless specified otherwise are surface mounted\.  Everything from the voltage regulators to the OP\-AMP and even our resistors and capacitors are surface\-mounted\. The only parts that aren’t surface mounted are the barrel jack, motor, microcontroller, and wall plug to supply power to the device\.  A variety of communication methods are utilized such as SPI, UART, and I2C\.  Our wall power supply supplies voltage at a measurement of 5V and 1A to a switching voltage regulator\. From the switching voltage regulator the power drops down and comes out to 3\.3 V\. Our force sensors are resistive which utilize an ADC device to convert their analog signals to SPI so it can be read by the microcontroller\. The ESP32 utilizes UART to communicate all this data over wifi to a digital storage space such as someone’s personal device or the medical records system at a doctor’s office\. 

# <a id="_ao0qcb5yu7bu"></a>Microcontroller Selection:

__Final Microcontroller Choice__: PIC16F18875\-I/P

__Rationale__: Team 208 decided to move forward with PIC16F18875\-I/P because of the three microcontrollers it had the most user and application notes\. It also meets all of the project's requirements at the lowest overhead and doesn’t require separate hardware to work\. This part also comes in a through hole and surface mount option for project implementation\.

# <a id="_yblz12ype5kz"></a>Software Proposal: 

__Description:  __For this project we decided to break up our software proposal into multiple different sections as we believed it would be easier for readers of this report to understand\. Each section shows how that part will operate and what it does as well\. We have the main loop showing how the overall process will happen along with the chain showing how the wifi will communicate with UART and the ESP32 device\.  The LED loop shows how many LEDs will turn on depending on how much force is applied to an object by a user when they are wearing the glove\. Depending on how much force is applied either the green or the red LED will then turn on\. The team used only one interrupt to run the update motor function every second\.

# <a id="_mm5pbku0hm01"></a>Hardware Proposal: 

Team Schematic

__Description:__ The team schematic has been broken into sections to reduce confusion\. There are six major sections in the team system\. These are the switching voltage regulator, temperature sensor, LED array, motor driver, force sensors, and the microcontroller\. Each section has arrows on the end of wires that connect to other sections\. These arrows indicate the exact pin that wire should connect to\.

Restated Customer Need

“So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while\. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing\. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand\. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own\.

After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind \- you know, like your body should\! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough\!

The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close\. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore\. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do\.

Obviously, your mileage may vary\. Everyone works at their own pace and can only do what they can, but I see how this device can help people relearn to use their hand\. She'll never be 100%, but every little bit counts\.”

1. The device uses a comfortable amount of pressure to provoke exercise\. \(explicit\)
2. The glove forces the user to extend and retract fingers to promote movement in limbs\. \(explicit\)
3. The device teaches the user how to “reuse” their hands to grab objects through movement exercises and pressure regulation\. \(latent\)

“What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use\. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor \(orange box\)\. Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training\. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius\. The mirror glove is worn on the non\-training hand\. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove\. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement\. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air\. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet\. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable\.”

1. The device allows for various levels of intensity\. \(explicit\)
2. The device is portable and can be used anywhere\. \(explicit\)
3. The glove allows for isolation to focus on finger training\. \(explicit\)

“All other sellers were showing delivery 2\+ months later and at higher price\. I took a chance here with only 2 review\. I am very pleasantly surprised with quick delivery\. The product works amazingly well for my brother who suffered a stroke and can’t move left arm/fingers\. Even the doctors, nurses and the physical therapists at the hospital are amazed when they see my brother using it while admitted\. It’s really helping with his rehabilitation\.I am in tech, and am super impressed that someone developed this\.”

1. The device helps provide relief\. \(latent\)
2. Provides help with rehabilitation\. \(explicit\)

However when you see it, all this is is the pump from a blood pressure cuff hooked to a glove with some tubing\. There is absolutely no reason why this costs $200\. This product could change the lives of millions if it were priced more reasonably\.”

1. Too expensive \(explicit\)
2. The design is not well made\. \(latent\)
3. The design should offer more options to the user for the price\. \(latent\)

“Been looking off & on for something like this for fingers curling\. A little tricky to thread all curled fingers in at first but saw results after only a few uses\. I can now insert those now straighter fingers without using my good hand to guide them in\. Sizing guide was spot on, snug at first that resulted in a perfect "break in" fit\. I wish I could leave more than five stars\.”

“It's important to understand that without proper occupational therapy training and the assistance of a portable stim device, this glove is of little help\.

1. Device should be easy to use \(explicit\)
2. Device should come with everything needed to operate \(latent\)
3. Shouldn’t need professional help to operate \(latent\)

__Product Requirements__

__Our Process:__

	The team decided that each major category of the product requirements will just be the major categories that our user needs are organized into\. These groups are not the suggested groups, but we felt like these will better inform our design based on our user needs\. This will make it easier to both rank and generate the product requirements\. The product requirement list below is organized from the most important major category at the top and least at the bottom\. Within each category the top most product requirement is the most important of that category\.

__Stakeholders:__

Target Users: People with nerve damage or limited mobility in the hand\.

Target Purchasers: This can be the target user directly or healthcare professionals for use in a facility\.

Sponsor and Advisors: ASU acts as a financial sponsor\. EGR314 and Professor Aukes act as advisors to the final product\.

__Use Cases:__

Case \#1: Mrs\. Haro has nerve damage in her right hand\. This has left her without the ability to gauge her grip strength or feel anything in her hand for that matter\. She decides to try out a new therapeutic device\. It's a glove that allows her to know her grip strength in her right hand\. This not only gives her more confidence and functionality in her hand, but also a mind\-body relationship with her grip strength as well\. A temperature sensor is integrated into the product so she doesn’t burn her hand on her hot coffee cup\.

Case \#2: Mr\. Jacobs got in a car accident recently and is recovering from his injuries\. His left hand is weak and suffers from clawing\. A healthcare professional decides that a new therapeutic machine is best for his physical therapy\. The new machine allows his hand to strengthen and accurately grip objects again\. The data from the machine is sent via wi\-fi to the hospital server\. Mr\. Jacobs doctor, after seeing the data, decides Jacobs is ready for stronger resistance on the machine\. The doctor plugs into the machine and alters the resistance via PuTTY motor control\. Jacobs recovers in a few weeks and no longer needs the machine to gauge his grip strength\.
