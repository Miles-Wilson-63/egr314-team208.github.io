 **“So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while\. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing\.

 **“What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use\. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor \(orange box\)\. Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training\. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius\. The mirror glove is worn on the non\-training hand\. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove\. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement\. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air\. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet\. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable\.”** | 1\.

 **“All other sellers were showing delivery 2\+ months later and at higher price\. I took a chance here with only 2 review\. I am very pleasantly surprised with quick delivery\. The product works amazingly well for my brother who suffered a stroke and can’t move left arm/fingers\. Even the doctors, nurses and the physical therapists at the hospital are amazed when they see my brother using it while admitted\. It’s really helping with his rehabilitation\.I am in tech, and am super impressed that someone developed this\.”**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1\.
