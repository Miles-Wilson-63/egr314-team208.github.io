| “So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1.

| After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind - you know, like your body should! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 3.

| The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                        |

| “What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor (orange box). Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius. The mirror glove is worn on the non-training hand. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable.” | 1. The device allows for various levels of intensity.
