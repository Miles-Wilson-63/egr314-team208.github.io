1. Felicia Szleszinski
2. Kyle Selasky
3. Miles Wilson
4. Mingqi Yu

**Preparation date:** 1/22/2023 

**Organisation information:**

* Class: _EGR314: Embedded Systems Design Project II_
* Professor: _Dan Aukes_

## 1. Team Organization

**Charter:**
* To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project.

**Product Mission Statement:**
* Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi.


## 2. User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
**Our Process:**
* To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design. 


## 3. Design Ideation

* For our design ideation process we agreed on four main categories to focus on. They were electrical, movement, material, and miscellaneous. Then all team members started listing ideas for what the product should have based on the main categories. The best brainstorming method for us was Rapid Ideation. We looked at all of our benchmarked products and took the best from each of them while finding ways to improve them .Then we just started throwing everything we could think of onto the jamboard until we couldn't come up with any more ideas. Mind mapping didn't work for us as we started coming up with too many main ideas we wanted to focus on and was taking too much time.

* After coming up with all the ideas we then went through each one individually and determined whether we wanted to include it or not and whether or not they meant our requirements for the project. Miles drew the Balloon Grip Sensor Therapeutic Glove while Kyle drew the Variable Force Sensing Temperature/Pressure Glove and Mingqi did the Velcro on Fingers for Various Sizes.
