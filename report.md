# Team 208's Charter

_Goals:_

- Create a project that is able to capture our audience's attention during the Innovation Showcase.
- Developing a great addition to our engineering portfolios.
- Getting experience using industry level tools to create our project.
- Create a project that solves/remedies a real world problem.
- Create a project that can sense and respond to two or more environmental conditions.
- Increase our knowledge of microcontrollers and interconnecting subsystems.
- Increase your proficiency in the use of the software and gain a clear understanding of how each module in MPLAB works and how it works.
- Improve team organization and coordination skills and clarify integrated common goals.

**Charter**

Based on the goals listed above and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter:

_To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project._

**Product Mission Statement**

Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

_Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi._

**Communication Channels**

**Communication Procedures**

_Team Communication:_

All team members will conduct communication to one another through text or Discord, in class collaboration and possibly through Zoom as seen in **Table 1**. Other alternative modes of communication include phone calls and emails. These will be used when necessary and will not be primary methods of communication.

_Instructor Correspondence:_

Felicia Szleszinski will be responsible for instructor correspondence and will communicate all information to the team via text.

**Meeting Schedule**

_ **Table 2** __: Team Member Availability Schedule_

![](RackMultipart20230123-1-9lv6x0_html_80c8eddb477fd2b4.png)

_Team Prefered Meeting Times:_

For our team, meeting on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm will be most effective based on the data collected in **Table 2.**

**Meeting Coordination**

_Team Preferred Meeting Reminder Format:_

To help maintain scheduled team meetings our team will utilize a shared calendar.

_Team Preferred Meeting Alterations:_

If a team member needs to alter the time of a scheduled meeting or add an additional meeting time, they will reach out to the other team members via text or verbally. Once all team members have confirmed the change it will be reflected in the shared calendar.

_Team Preferred Meeting Format:_

Meeting face to face will be the most effective way for our team to communicate, followed by the voice channel in discord as our primary second choice. If those options are not available, meeting virtually is also applicable.

_Team Other Necessary Procedures:_

Phone call communication is our alternative means of contact to notify of emergencies or last minute additional meetings. This resource will only be utilized if the primary communication sources were unsuccessful.

**Team Coordination**

_Team Preferred Assignment Sign Off and Submission:_

The team member submitting the assignment will always check with all the other team members that the assignment is ready to submit before submitting. This will happen via one of our primary communication methods. If a team member does not respond to this, secondary methods of communication will be used. If there is no response from either of these, the team member submitting will be allowed to submit without the unresponsive team member's approval.

_Individual Team Member Comprehension and Adjustment:_

Team members should always inform the team if they don't have the knowledge or skills to perform the work assigned. The team will come together and help each other to complete this work. Hopefully this will help the team learn together rather than struggle separately.

_Team Feedback Coordination:_

Feedback from assignments will be discussed by the team together. This will help us understand both the good and the bad parts of the assignment. The editing of documents according to feedback can be done individually if the team decides to divide and conquer. But the most important part is that we talk through it briefly to know what to do on future assignments.

**Team Accountability**

_Accountability Expectations:_

All team members should be contributing equally. Of course, with different expertises in different areas, varying amounts of work will be performed per each team member. This is not a problem as long as everyone is committed to working together and diligently.

_Recognizing Underperforming Team members:_

If a team member feels that themselves or another team member is underperforming it should be brought to the attention of the entire team. Signs of this include not attending meetings, classes, not helping each other, or not doing the work assigned.

_Supporting Team Members:_

Each team member is responsible for making sure their own and each other's workloads are balanced. Helping each other and working together are the best ways to succeed in the course. Because of this, team members should not be afraid to ask for help when needed.

_Accountability Consequences:_

A discussion about why and how the underperformance is happening will happen. Hopefully a solution is found and the team member gets the help he/she needs. If it is not resolved, the professor will be contacted and informed on the situation.

**Conflict and Resolution**

Controversy or difference in opinions is expected in any group setting, however we all have the shared goal of learning and should always be respectful to one another. For our group, I don't believe this will be an issue, however if any issues arise then we will host a group meeting with all team members to come up with a compromise or resolution for the conflict.

**Team 208 User Needs and Benchmarking**

**Our Process:**

To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design.

**Benchmarking**

**Our Process:**

The team met on Discord again to do the benchmarking. First we agreed that we would look up ideas relating to Parkinson's or nerve damage therapy relating to the hand. This produced a few different products that the team thought were interesting and helpful. We analyzed the positive and negative comments on each product to get more user needs directly from users.

| "So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own.
After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind - you know, like your body should! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough!
The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do.
Obviously, your mileage may vary. Everyone works at their own pace and can only do what they can, but I see how this device can help people relearn to use their hand. She'll never be 100%, but every little bit counts." |
1. The device uses a comfortable amount of pressure to provoke exercise. (explicit)
2. The glove forces the user to extend and retract fingers to promote movement in limbs. (explicit)
3. The device teaches the user how to "reuse" their hands to grab objects through movement exercises and pressure regulation. (latent)
 |
| "What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor (orange box). Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius. The mirror glove is worn on the non-training hand. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable." |
1. The device allows for various levels of intensity. (explicit)
2. The device is portable and can be used anywhere. (explicit)
3. The glove allows for isolation to focus on finger training. (explicit)

| "All other sellers were showing delivery 2+ months later and at higher price. I took a chance here with only 2 review. I am very pleasantly surprised with quick delivery. The product works amazingly well for my brother who suffered a stroke and can't move left arm/fingers. Even the doctors, nurses and the physical therapists at the hospital are amazed when they see my brother using it while admitted. It's really helping with his rehabilitation.I am in tech, and am super impressed that someone developed this." |

| "Been looking off & on for something like this for fingers curling. A little tricky to thread all curled fingers in at first but saw results after only a few uses. I can now insert those now straighter fingers without using my good hand to guide them in. Sizing guide was spot on, snug at first that resulted in a perfect "break in" fit. I wish I could leave more than five stars." |

| "Extremely big!! The description says s/m/l but when I received the item the package said one size fits all. And that was more of an accurate description of the item. Didn't fit my child size hands lol if I knew it was one size fits all I would've never bought this item. I did send it back and got my refund" |

**Product Requirements**

**Our Process:**

The team decided that each major category of the product requirements will just be the major categories that our user needs are organized into. These groups are not the suggested groups, but we felt like these will better inform our design based on our user needs. This will make it easier to both rank and generate the product requirements. The product requirement list below is organized from the most important major category at the top and least at the bottom. Within each category the top most product requirement is the most important of that category.

**Stakeholders:**

Target Users: People with nerve damage or limited mobility in the hand.

Target Purchasers: This can be the target user directly or healthcare professionals for use in a facility.

Sponsor and Advisors: ASU acts as a financial sponsor. EGR314 and Professor Aukes act as advisors to the final product.

**Use Cases:**

Case #1: Mrs. Haro has nerve damage in her right hand. This has left her without the ability to gauge her grip strength or feel anything in her hand for that matter. She decides to try out a new therapeutic device. It's a glove that allows her to know her grip strength in her right hand. This not only gives her more confidence and functionality in her hand, but also a mind-body relationship with her grip strength as well. A temperature sensor is integrated into the product so she doesn't burn her hand on her hot coffee cup.

Case #2: Mr. Jacobs got in a car accident recently and is recovering from his injuries. His left hand is weak and suffers from clawing. A healthcare professional decides that a new therapeutic machine is best for his physical therapy. The new machine allows his hand to strengthen and accurately grip objects again. The data from the machine is sent via wi-fi to the hospital server. Mr. Jacobs doctor, after seeing the data, decides Jacobs is ready for stronger resistance on the machine. The doctor plugs into the machine and alters the resistance via PuTTY motor control. Jacobs recovers in a few weeks and no longer needs the machine to gauge his grip strength.

**Aspects:**

1. **Safety (\*\*\*):**

1.1) The product's structural components must not pinch, cut, or injure the user.

## Generated Ideas:

For Team 208's Design Ideation, we chose to look at what characteristics made our benchmarked examples successful products and how they could be improved upon. Listed below are one hundred ideas that discuss various aspects of potential design movements, material considerations, electrical component ideas, and other other potential successful characteristics.

Once we had come up with one hundred ideas, we separated them into color coordinated categories and grouped them based on their ability to meet our project requirements.
